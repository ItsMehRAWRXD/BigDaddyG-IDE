## 🚀 How Anyone Can Recreate Your Full Project

```bash
# Clone repository (676 KB download)
git clone https://github.com/ItsMehRAWRXD/BigDaddyG-IDE.git
cd BigDaddyG-IDE

# Install dependencies (~450 MB)
npm install

# Run the IDE
npm start

# Build installer (~65 MB)
npm run build:win
```

**Result:** Full 21 GB development environment recreated from 676 KB source!

## 🔧 Git Issue Resolution

### Problem Discovered
- System Git at `C:\Program Files\Git` was **missing** `git-remote-https.exe`
- This prevented HTTPS operations (push, pull, clone via HTTPS)

### Solution Applied
Used **Visual Studio 2022's Git installation** which has all components:
```
D:\Microsoft Visual Studio 2022\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\
Microsoft\TeamFoundation\Team Explorer\Git\
```

### Permanent Fix (Optional)
Run `PERMANENT-GIT-FIX.ps1` to choose:
1. Update system PATH to use VS Git (admin required)
2. Use project-specific config (no admin)
3. Copy missing file to system Git (admin required)
