```bash

# 1. Verify RCK Bootstrap

node electron/hardening/rck-bootstrap.js

# Expected: ✅ All 40 patches verified

# 2. Check Attestation Signature

openssl dgst -sha256 \
  -verify ~/.bigdaddy/rck/rck-public.pem \
  -signature ~/.bigdaddy/rck/attestation.sig \
  ~/.bigdaddy/rck/rck-attestation.json

# Expected: Verified OK ✅

# 3. Confirm Integrity State

cat ~/.bigdaddy/rck/rck-attestation.json | jq .integrity

# Expected: "PRISTINE" ✅

# 4. Validate SBOM

cat ~/.bigdaddy/rck/rck-sbom.json | jq .spdxVersion

# Expected: "SPDX-2.3" ✅

# 5. Review Audit Log

tail ~/.bigdaddy/rck/rck-audit.jsonl

# Expected: Continuous verification logs ✅
