# ⚖️ BigDaddyG IDE - Legal Compliance & Clean-Room Implementation

> **"Functionally identical to Cursor, but 100% original code"**

## 🎯 **Core Principle:**

**BigDaddyG IDE is a CLEAN-ROOM IMPLEMENTATION:**

✅ **No copied code from Cursor**  
✅ **No reverse-engineered binaries**  
✅ **No EULA violations**  
✅ **No copyright infringement**  
✅ **100% original implementation**  

**We studied Cursor's PUBLIC features and built our own from scratch.**
